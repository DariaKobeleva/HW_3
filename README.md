# ColorizedApp

## Task Description
The initial task was to create an app that allows users to change the background color of the view using sliders. Each slider's value is displayed in a corresponding label, and the slider's color to the left of the thumb matches the color it controls.

### Additional Enhancements

- Added a new screen, which is now the startup screen of the app.
- The screen with the sliders is now a settings screen where the background color for the main screen can be configured.
- When navigating to the settings screen, the current color of the main screen is passed to the settings screen.
- Upon closing the settings screen, the selected color is passed back to the main screen using delegation.

## What I Learned:

- Basics of UIKit
- Working with multiple view controllers
- Passing data between view controllers
- Learning and implementing protocols and delegation in iOS
